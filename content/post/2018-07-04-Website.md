A beginner's tutorial for building a static website on Github with Hugo.
<!--more-->

Finally, my website is live. ðŸ™‚
I am fairly new to Github and [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), so I thought Iâ€™d write down how I did it. This is blog is for complete beginners and Mac users.
<!-- toc -->

# Step 1: Install essentials
First, you need to install [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), which is a generator for static websites. Once everything is set up, you can simply write blogs as markdown files and Hugo will automatically generate all the html pages for you. Cool.<br>
A detailed tutorial for Hugo can be found [here](http://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/). Install [`Homebrew`](https://brew.sh/), and then:
```
brew install hugo
```
You will also need [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and a [SSH key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/) for Github. Here are some helpful tutorials for [generating](http://bficores.colorado.edu/biofrontiers-it/hackathon-resources/generating-an-ssh-key) a key and [adding](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/) it to Github.<br>
Once Hugo is installed, you can create a new directory for the site:
```
hugo new site Yue_blog
```
Pick a [theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/) for your site (I selected the theme [tranquilpeak](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/)). cd into the directory, and add the theme.
```
cd Yue_blog
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme.git themes/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme
```

# Step 2: Build a site locally
The quickest way to get a working site is to copy everything from the {{< hl-text orange >}}exampleSite{{< /hl-text >}} folder provided by the theme. ðŸ™‚
```
# Start from the site directory
pwd # get path to this directory
cd themes/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/exampleSite/
cp -a * /Path/to/site/directory/Yue_blog
# Get back to the site directory
cd ../../..
```
Similarly, update the files in the {{< hl-text orange >}}layouts{{< /hl-text >}} and the {{< hl-text orange >}}archetypes{{< /hl-text >}} folders with the provided layouts and archetypes from the theme.<br>
```
cd themes/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/layouts/
cp * /Path/to/site/directory/Yue_blog/layouts
cd themes/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/archetypes/
cp * /Path/to/site/directory/Yue_blog/archetypes
```
Now, try the following command and see what happens:
```
hugo server
```
Open a web browser and navigate to [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313).

# Step 3: Customize your site

Your new website is working (locally). But it's not quite yours yet. Better add some original content. From now on, all you need to do is to edit the configuration file {{< hl-text primary >}}config.toml{{< /hl-text >}}, and stuff in the {{< hl-text orange >}}content{{< /hl-text >}} folder. I will provide a few examples in the following blog [post](/2018/07/how-to-host-your-personal-website-on-github-using-hugo-2/2/).

# Step 4: Create Github respositories

You will need to create two repositories, one (BLOG) will contain all the source files, and the other one (USERNAME[.github.io](https://pages.github.com/)) will contain the generated website. A detailed tutorial can be found in [here](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/).<br>
Link the BLOG repository to your local directory.
```
cd Yue_blog
git remote add origin https://github.com/YueYvetteHao/Yue_blog.git
```
Sync the local and remote repositories
```
git pull origin master
```
Remove the {{< hl-text orange >}}public{{< /hl-text >}} folder and add it back as a git [submodule](https://chrisjean.com/git-submodules-adding-using-removing-and-updating/).
```
rm -rf public
git add .
git commit -m "updates ..."
git push origin master
git submodule add -b master git@github.com:YueYvetteHao/YueYvetteHao.github.io.git public
```

# Step 5: Deploy - hello world!
Get the deploy script [here](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#put-it-into-a-script) and save it in the BLOG repo. Run the shell script to compile the markdown files into html, git add and git commit to the USERNAME.github.io repo:

```
sh deploy.sh
```
Done! The website {{< hl-text blue >}}https://YueYvetteHao.github.io{{< /hl-text >}} is now running. ðŸ™‚<br>
This is how I built my first personal website. I hope this tutorial is helpful!
